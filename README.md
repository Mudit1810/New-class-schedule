## üíª Usage Guide

### Initial Setup
1. **Add Resources**: Create classrooms, courses, teachers, and class groups
2. **Assign Teachers**: Link teachers to specific courses for each class group
3. **Generate Timetable**: Create an initial schedule with automatic conflict avoidance

### Timetable Management
1. **Drag-and-Drop Adjustments**: Rearrange classes by dragging them to new timeslots
2. **Conflict Resolution**: When conflicts occur, review suggestions and resolve them
3. **Room Management**: Find available rooms or reschedule classes as needed

### Advanced Operations
- Access teacher workload statistics via the analytics dashboard
- Review room utilization patterns to optimize space usage
- Approve and finalize timetables with the approval system
- Export timetables for sharing or printing
